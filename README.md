# Projectable
### By Felix McKenzie & Robert Neville

Projectable is a lightweight project management applications that assists teams,
of any size and type, to collaborate and track the progress of their work. 
It is a free, open source alternative that puts user experience first.

It is the final project for our Coder Academy studies.

## The Why

Visual representation is vital when planning a project in a team setting as it 
conveys high level information to all involved. A Project Manager is responsible 
for taking a project from ideation to completion, and navigating the team through 
every step and problem in-between. Many Project Managers are faced with new 
challenges in today's post-pandemic world, now trying to lead their teams and 
projects through a completely remote, work-from-home environment. Moreover, 
it seems remote work is here to stay: 74% of professionals expect remote work 
to become standard, with 97% not wanting to return to the office full-time 
(Prossack, 2021). How can teams achieve the same level of success in a distributed 
workforce?

Task management and communication is central to the success of any Project Manager 
and team. Projects are made up of dozens of tasks each with their own level of 
difficulty and time requirements. 77% of high-performing projects use project 
management software, yet only 22% of organizations actually make the investment 
(TeamStage, 2020).

While several project management tools exist on the market, many have been met 
with criticism from users. Existing tools such as Jira are feature rich, however 
can be complicated to use, with unintuitive workflows and slow load times, and most 
importantly no dark mode. Simpler alternatives, such as Trello and Asana, provide a 
lower barrier to entry, however are capped by a paywall once you reach their free 
tier limit.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
